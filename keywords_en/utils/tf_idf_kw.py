Escape to Freedom now also available in Mandarin and Spanish "Escape to Freedom" is a new animated video from the Free Software Foundation (FSF), giving an introduction to the concepts behind software freedom: both what we gain by having it, and what rights are at stake. We now have the video available in Mandarin and Spanish language tracks. 2022 Bulletin: "Unjust Algorithms" by ZoÃ« Kooyman Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) injustices have rapidly taken a turn for the worse in recent years. Algorithmic decision-making systems are used more than ever by organizations, educational institutions, and governments looking for ways to increase understanding and make predictions. The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is working through this issue, and its many scenarios, to be able to say useful things about how this relates to software freedom. Our call for papers on Copilot was a first step in this direction. Free software means that the users have the freedom to run, edit, contribute to, and share the software. Thus, free software is a matter of liberty, not price. We have been defending the rights of all software users for the past 35 years. Help sustain us for many more; become an associate member today.

"This community that we have, that were building, that does so much, has to grow. We cant compete with Apple, we cant compete with Google, directly, in the field of resources. What we can eventually do is head count and heart count. We can compete on the ground of ideology because ours is better." -- Edward Snowden, NSA whisteblower, speaking at LibrePlanet 2016.
